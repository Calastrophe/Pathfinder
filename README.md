# Pathfinder
A graph theory inspired path generator using adjacency matrix. I'm not quite sure what the algorithm would be called, but I just handmade a solution.

This program finds EVERY single possible path from start to end, without repeating a node. Do not enter a large matrix unless you are willing wait and grow old.

This was more so a toy project, things are not optimized or using a specific algorithm.
