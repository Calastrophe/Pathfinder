# Pathfinder
A graph theory inspired path generator using adjacency matrix. I have no idea about the algorithims involved in this stuff, so I just linear searched it or whatever.

This was more so a toy project, things are not optimized or using a specific algorithm.

Adjust the matrix size by making size=(some number squared) and then shoving its square into where 60,60 is.
